### Comparison with the state-of-the-art

The full super-resolution results on Urban 100, BSD 100, and Sun-Hays 80 are available.
 * [Urban 100](https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/65upg43jjd0a4cwsiqgl6o6ixube6klm.zip) (1.14 GB)
 * [BSD 100](https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/qgctsplb8txrksm9to9x01zfa4m61ngq.zip) (568 MB)
 * [Sun-Hays 80](https://uofi.box.com/shared/static/rirohj4773jl7ef752r330rtqw23djt8.zip) (311 MB)

In each dataset, we include results of the state-of-the-art single image super-resolution algorithms, including
  * **HR**: High-resolution images. All images were cropped so that each dimension is a multiplication of the super-resolution factor. This avoids the misalignment problem in the quantitative comparison.
  * **LR**: Low-resolution test image generated with bicubic kernel with downsampling.
  * **bicubic**: Bicubic interpolation.
  * **nearest**: nearest interpolation.
  * **Our**: Our result.
